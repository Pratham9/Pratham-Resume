\location{The 9-year-old Pratham had one dream: to go to space. While I was fascinated by the innovations in the field of physics, I found my passion in computers due to the creative freedom that they granted, and I pursued further education to learn more about them. Today, I am thrilled to apply at Unity, since not only does it allow me to be a part of a world leader in interactive experiences impacting billions of users, but it also allows me to inclusively contribute alongside a team of experts with values that align with my goals, allowing me to turn dreams into shared experiences.}

    \item \location{In addition, I have a strong understanding of software development methodologies, such as MVC Framework, Agile, and Waterfall from the projects that I led. }
    \item \location{Having led multiple group projects I understand what it means to lead people, and have developed my skills in communication, strategic-planning, decision making, analytical thinking, and delegation of tasks. }
